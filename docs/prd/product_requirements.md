### 8.2 Market Analysis

While a comprehensive market analysis is not within the scope of this PRD, the product will operate in a space that includes code analysis tools, documentation generators, and development productivity tools. The open source with paid support model aims to balance accessibility with sustainability.

The primary differentiator for this product is the integration of code visualization, LLM-powered querying, and automated documentation generation in a single tool, specifically targeting the developer onboarding and documentation maintenance pain points.
